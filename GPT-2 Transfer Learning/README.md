# Introduction
This project was inspired by the similarity in the introduction of The Stig in TV Show Top Gear UK by BBC UK. The host Jeremy Clarkson used to introduce The Stig with some humorous sentences such as:
```
Some say he’s wanted by the CIA and that he sleeps upside down like a Bat. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
Some say he naturally faces magnetic north, and that all his legs are hydraulic. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
Some say that he lives in a tree, and that his sweat can be used to clean precious metals. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
```
Observing this pattern, more examples can be generated by using language models. The language model used for this purpose is GPT-2 as it has a large vocabulary and GPT-2 has been used to generate dialogues such as Microsoft DialoGPT.  
  
The model was fine tuned for this task for generating such examples.

# Dataset
The original dialogues can be found on this [website](https://www.topgearbox.com/stig-quotes/). The dialogues are saved in the `stig-introductions.txt` file and the language model was fine tuned using Google Colab.

# Good Examples
After fine tuning, the model was able to generate some good examples such as:
```
Some say that his new Christmas range of fragrances includes the great smell of ‘Wednesday’, and that he has a section in his house that allows his cats to sleep on him. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
Some say that he sucks the air from his shoes, and that he invented the curtain call, and is currently unreachable by Windows Media Centre. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
Some say that he has a digital face that looks like a Twister, and is tipped with an abundance of nectar. All we know is he’s called the Stig.
```
More examples can be found in the `Collection of Good Samples.txt` file, or can be generated through the model. This code can also be used for generating more such dialogues.
